🚀 Data Structures – Intro & Implementations

This repository contains my implementations and learning notes from an introductory Data Structures course.
It covers the essential structures and algorithms used in programming.

📘 What’s Inside?
🔹 Arrays & Circular Arrays

Basics of linear and circular arrays

Why circular arrays are more efficient

🔹 Linked Lists

Single, double, and circular linked lists

Insert, delete, search, traversal

🔹 Stacks & Queues

LIFO and FIFO concepts

Array & linked-list based implementations

🔹 Recursion

Core concepts

Simple recursive problem models

🔹 Trees

Tree basics and terminology

Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
